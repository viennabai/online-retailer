# Customer-Centric Analysis of an Online Retailer

Motivation: The success of a company is based on how much we understand our customers and their needs. 

We are provided with a dataset of an online retailer based in the UK. The dataset includes invoices of our customers for the past 13 months. We can gather insight about geographic reach, purchasing patterns, and product analysis through EDA. Then, we can use consumer behavior metrics (recency, frequency, and monetary value) to segment our customers, and thus develop more targeted approaches to better meet their needs.
